# [Exploit the Unknown Gradually: One-Shot Video-Based Person Re-Identification by Stepwise Learning](https://yu-wu.net/pdf/CVPR2018_Exploit-Unknown-Gradually.pdf)

Pytorch implementation for our paper [[Link]](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Wu_Exploit_the_Unknown_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf).
This code is based on the [Open-ReID](https://github.com/Cysu/open-reid) library.

## Preparation
### Dependencies
- Python 3.6
- PyTorch (version >= 0.2.0)
- h5py, scikit-learn, metric-learn, tqdm

### Download datasets 
- DukeMTMC-VideoReID: This [page](https://github.com/Yu-Wu/DukeMTMC-VideoReID) contains more details and baseline code.
- MARS: [[Google Drive]](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1m6yLgtQdhb6pLCcb6_m7sj0LLBRvkDW0) Â  [[BaiduYun]](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1mByTdvXFsmobXOXBEkIWFw).

## Train

For the DukeMTMC-VideoReID dataset:
```shell
python3 run.py --dataset DukeMTMC-VideoReID --logs_dir logs/DukeMTMC-VideoReID_EF_10/ --EF 10 --mode Dissimilarity --max_frames 900
```

For the MARS datasaet:
```
python3 run.py --dataset mars --logs_dir logs/mars_EF_10/ --EF 10 --mode Dissimilarity --max_frames 900
```
It takes about 10 hours to train EUG (EF=10%) on DukeMTMC-VideoReID with a GTX1080Ti. Please set the `max_frames` smaller if your GPU memory is less than 11G.

## Performances

The performances varies according to random splits for initial labeled data. To reproduce the performances in our paper, please use the one-shot splits at `./examples/`

## Future work

In the extended version,  We improve EUG by leveraging the remaining unselected data in an unsupervised way, which shows a great performance improvement on the image-based re-ID datasets (Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID).
